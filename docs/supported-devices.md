# Supported Devices

Any ESP32 device should be able to run Tactility, because drivers can be implemented for any hardware.
Some hardware combinations are officially supported.

Recommendations:
- LilyGO: [LilyGo T-Deck Plus](devices/lilygo-tdeck-plus.md) is currently the best-supported device: all features are working and performance is great.
- Elecrow: [CrowPanel Advance 2.8"](devices/elecrow-crowpanel-advance-28.md): This device also has great performance. It offers an extra USB UART and several external ports.
- M5Stack: [Core2](devices/m5stack-core2.md) is recommended.

Memory: 游릲 = no external RAM, 游릴 = external RAM present

SD card: 游릴 = working, 游린 = unavailable/broken/not implemented

ROM: System storage size. This allows for a larger `/data` partition which stores configuration and other mutable data.

Ext: This stands for "extended features". If available, it allows apps to directly control display and touch devices. Currently unavailable for RGB/i80 displays.

 (\*) These boards are not owned by the developer, so quality control is limited to community efforts.
